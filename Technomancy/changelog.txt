Technomancy Changelog

v5.12.0: (11/6/18) Alchemy
Started some work on alchemist! There's now 2 ingredients to collect. When getting mana purifier, it says it lasts through prestige now. Also added 4 new tower floors, 3 of which improve autobuild (if you have it) and the last gives you more mana! Also an AI Unit upgrade that's probably broken!

v5.11.0: (11/3/18) Turkeys!
Halloween has ended. No more candy for you. Also, there's some wild turkeys to kill. Fixed a bug with getting negative fuel from the magic bag. 

v5.10.1: (10/18/18) Minor changes
Prestige and quickmana work a bit better now. Halloween candy now stacks properly when used. Perfect logikittens no longer give essence or magic bag. Spikey kneepads now do something.

v5.10.0: (10/12/18) Autobuild, balance changes, and bugfixes
Autobuild has been added! Get it from finishing the Cascade challenge!
When entering a challenge, mana you would get on prestige is added to the total you get when you finish (instead of it disappearing). Buying an upgrade to finish a crisis gives a hint about the wanderer. No upgrade challenge suggests you have the magic bag before starting it. You can now use halloween candy without already having a potion going. If you have enough mana, it now says that the risky regulation might be worth it. 

v5.9.1: (10/10/18) Minor bugfixes.
It is now actually possible to trick or treat. If there have been multiple updates since you last refreshed, it shows you all of them. When choosing events with purified mana, you can't choose an event you can't afford. Finishing the environmental crisis no longer gives a ~.5% boost to production (or whatever insignificantly small amount it was). Enchantments now scale by log base 2 instead of ~2.08.

v5.9.0: (10/7/18) Halloween
When adventuring, you'll now randomly encounter houses to trick or treat at. Don't ask why they're in space. The halloween theme now has fabulous music to go along with it. In the export save fallback, Ctrl+A and Ctrl+C should now work properly.

v5.8.3: Even more minor bugfix
Now both ways export can fail should properly fall back.

v5.8.2: (10/7/18) Minor bugfixes
Saving should theoretically now work for bluerobes. Tower floor 23 reward now works properly for money. Poverty challenge description fixed.

v5.8.1: (9/28/18) Bugfixes
Trying to make mithril cloth without enough resources gives the proper error message now. Any building built by the game should no longer say you don't have enough resources (mostly relevant for Cascade challenge). Changed current final tower floor a bit. It's super OP now (maybe). The automatic update checker now theoretically won't hang your game if you lose internet connection. No upgrade challenge also gives you 200 mana. 

v5.8.0: (9/23/18) Bugfixes and some more tower stuff
Fixed a display bug with cath notification settings. Meteors will no longer hit the last copy of a building. Workshop tooltip no longer shows up in resource tracking tooltips. When in No Upgrade Challenge, trades no longer flicker (and simply don't appear). Added a new tower floor, with rewards that may change (so you might want to hold off on killing it). Added some new combat messages in the tower. Added content to the tavern.

v5.7.1: (9/19/18) Minor Bugfixes and balance
Meteor challenge meteors fall at half the rate now, but speed time makes more fall (sorry, no more abusing offline progress to make it easier). You're no longer severly penalized for having a lot of money in your Magic Bag when doing a poverty challenge. You can no longer enter the main tower in a challenge. Unlocking tavern happens at the right boss now. 

v5.7.0: (9/18/18) 
Added a couple clues for the clouds of dust at Piscine. Fix a bug with the game not automatically checking for updates. Added a new tower boss and name/description for the previous two that didn't have one. Also, this adds the tavern which isn't fully implemented yet, but will allow you to upgrade your party. 

v5.6.0: (9/4/18) Not as terrible bugs
Fixed some stuff with how the bag of folding works with prestige resources. Also, sandcastles are now worth 1/2 as much (they were incorrectly being counted twice previously, and now it's fixed). Added a couple new tower floors, but they're not really finished yet. The rewards work, but no boss names/descriptions. Added more links in the tower to help you get back to the base. Oh, and the tower warrior should now work properly, at least once you've killed the boss on floor 20.

v5.5.0: (9/2/18) BUGS!
Absolutely no testing in this version! It'll hopefully not break stuff too bad. Anyways, there's a few more hints for what to do in adventure (one at Piscine, one at Abandoned World, one at Cath when getting starchart). The settings menu is now not in the exact same place adventuring is because that annoyed me. Hopefully the game should now alert you when there's an update and you're still playing, but it might not. Workshop and enchanting table now tell you how they work (hopefully well enough) and enchanting table has some things changed to be more mechanically different than workshop. Workshop tells you to check your ship stock instead of warehouse. The warrior in the tower now (theoretically) can help fight for you. Don't let them die! Also, added 4 more floors to the tower. You can now beat up some random British dude and his brother!

v5.4.1: (8/30/18) Settings
When fueling your ship, it should show higher precision numbers for how much fuel you have. There's also now a settings menu for a bunch of stuff at top that was getting crowded. And a couple new things in there: You can (maybe) get notified when Cath resources are off cooldown, and you can use scientific notation instead of normal suffixes. Also there's a donate link that hopefully works.

v5.4.0: (8/22/18) Even more tower
Cath purchase timer should now reset on prestige. Also 5 new tower floors (and 4 new functional tower rewards. Next one coming soon!)

v5.3.0: (8/19/18) More tower floors
I actually tested stuff this time! Added a couple new tower floors and added a new spell: AI. It gives managers (currently at a terrible rate, but it should get upgrades to improve it later). Bag of folding is slightly better if you've finished meteor challenge and don't have a lot of resources in it. When grinding the tower, you now don't need to do it alone! Bring along a buddy to heal you... if you've gotten high enough. 

v5.2.1: (8/17/18) Tower bugfixes
I guess I should really test stuff first. Anyways, tower should be functional again. And if you play NGU, have you taken your drink?

v5.2.0: (8/17/18) More tower stuff
Meteors challenge should no longer hit unbuyable buildings. Expect a nerf to speed time on it soon (meteors will hit faster if time is sped). Added floor 8 to the tower, which unlocks a smaller tower to grind some Essence. Oh, also that tower to grind essence might have horribly broken stuff with the regular tower and/or is horribly broken itself. Added some messages for tower buttons so they feel less meaningless.

v5.1.1: (8/16/18) Balance stuff and bugfixes
If you've finished the environmental crisis you can now buy books at Cath. Also a few unbuyable buildings after it are now buyable, but at high costs. Getting a ton of time should no longer count against you. You can no longer destroy unbuyable buildings. Bags of holding say they disappear on prestige. Refined mana can no longer warp in resources you have a negative amount of. And that's pretty much it.

v5.1.0: (8/13/18) Bugfixes and more tower
Changed the no encounter text as it's now a known bug. I'll get around to fixing it eventually. 3 new upgrades added! Get them from beating tower boss 7. Also fixed a few bugs with the essence and mana not displaying properly until refresh. 

v5.0.3: (8/13/18) More bugfixes
Fixed a typo when getting cheese. Mage skills should no longer lock you out of the warpgate. Increased solar panel glass cost and generation post-environmental disaster.

v5.0.2: (8/12/18) The Tower
Fixed a bug where using some potions in quick succession could give you negative resources per second. If this continues to appear, tell me what potions you used and I'll fix it on those. Meteor and loan challenges now have rewards. Removed the option to delete some buildings (hydrogen mine, basic challenge rewards, and mana purifier)

v5.0.1: (8/8/18) The Tower
Small bugfixes: Fixed omnivision (second one) to properly show values, not hoe much you have. It should no longer push some buttons down in the resource pane. Also, convolution cube no longer requires "antibag". 

v5.0.0: (8/7/18) The Tower
You can now actually do stuff at the tower. Climb up the tower, killing various bosses in a horrible game of rock paper scissors and gain great rewards along the way! But it'll really tax your mana - I hope you have a lot stored up.

v4.6.0: (8/7/18) The Tower
Finished another couple mage skills. Omnivision and distributed mana are done. One gives you a boost to mana gained depending on your resource values. One lets you see some more stats (and I can add more in the future if I remember). Also probably another 3 gamebreaking bugs added.

v4.5.0: (8/7/18) The Tower
Fixed a bug that made prestiging just not work at all. Magic bag now has hotkey "B". No upgrade challenge has a reward: you get 1 essence! Essence unlocks the tower, which lets you get even more essence. It also gives a 10% (additive) production bonus to most resources for each essence you have. (Tower hotkey is "T")

v4.4.1: (8/6/18) Start challenge rewards
Basic challenge now actually has a reward, but it'll take a lot of mana to get full use from it! Fixed a bug with getting quick mana from the mage skill. The game should actually load now. 

v4.4.0: (8/5/18) Version 4.4.0: (8/5/18): Version Okay, that's enough.
Added a new challenge: No upgrade challenge! You just don't get upgrades. Sounds fun. Mithril cloth mithril cost 1000 -> 150 (5 bags of holding). Enchanting table should now actually work with casino tokens.

v4.3.0: (7/30/18) Bag of Folding
You're slightly likeier to get void, but it reduces the fullness of the black hole. Changed challenge rewards to describe what they likely will be. Check it out and if you have a good reward idea, please tell me! Also, added the bag of folding. It lets you throw resources in it, and then get some free resources at the start of each prestige!

v4.2.0: (7/20/18) Even More Challenge
Two new challenges: cascade and disco. Cascade will take some planning!

v4.1.3: (7/19/18) More Challenge
You should now actually get a logicat when adventuring where logicats appear.

v4.1.2: (7/18/18) More challenge
Meteors no longer hit mana stones and spell buildings. They also should update the amount it displays you have. Also, the meteor event is now no longer a good thing when in the challenge. It's very painful actually.

v4.1.2: (7/17/18) More challenge
When in a challenge you can now only have 5 hydrogen mines. This should make them harder. Hydrogen mines also generate less hydrogen, but since they're still uncapped, eh.

v4.1.1: (7/16/18) More challenge
Oops, it now shouldn't force you into meteor challenge.

v4.1.0: (7/16/18) More challenge
The challenge gate is now a warp gate location. Meteor challenge should actually be a thing now. Poverty challenge max money reduced (40s of production -> 20s, because I remembered money printers exist). Manufacturing tooltips are correct if you're an inventor now. Halloween theme is once again available, because why not.

v4.0.2: (7/1/18) 
Fixed some stuff with the casino rewards. They should now actually purchase correctly.

v4.0.1: (6/15/18) Challenges!
Minor balance: reduced the costs of some stuff, mostly iron costs.

v4.0.0: (6/15/18) Challenges!
There's now a few challenges you can do! Theoretically all but meteor challenge should be working, but there's probably bugs. Oh, also you can go to adventure mode as soon as you have any fuel. 

v3.23.0: (6/13/18) Challenge stuff
Added a new "planet", right off of Marine World (the casino). You can see the current planned challenges there, and it'll be where you start them! Oh, also I changed some CSS stuff with tables, so if you notice a place where they look terrible tell me. And challenges should be coming soon! More hype!

v3.22.4: (6/13/18) Bugfixes.
Fixed a bug where (theoretically) you could get NaN mana on prestige. Getting mana before prestige from the mage skill should now correctly unlock new spells without needing to refresh. Moved some code around to hopefully make it more performant. Also, started some stuff for the implementation of challenges! Get hyped! Oh, and I'm putting dates in the changelog now.

v3.22.3: I need to add a settings menu sometime
Sandcastles give 10m prestige value again (instead of their previous weird formula). You can now set the update rate - it switches between 100ms (fast) and 1000ms (slow). Mithril plating now gives more shields. It's also called mithril plating when you craft it (not adamantium). 

v3.22.2: 
Your logicat level and stealth level are now shown at the place where you first find them. You can now buy some prizes at the casino. How useful are they? Find out!

v3.22.1: Small changes you don't care about
Added a tooltip for another mage skill, fixed being able to prestige for negative mana. Also, there's a new enchantment. You can get casino tokens easier now! And there's an interface to spend them on prizes, but it doesn't let you do that yet. Feel free to give me suggestions for specific prizes!

v3.22.0: Enchantments!
There's now some enchantments you can make. Effectively, you start it, wait a while (1-24hrs, affected by time speed), and can then claim it for a reward! (Click the GREEN button on the dropdown to get your reward). Note that you'll need to prestige to be able to do this.

v3.21.0: I guess this is a version
How do you like unfinished content? I love it! Anyways, there's a new spell building available. It's kind of like the workshop, but more useless, mostly because you can't do anything with it. Oh, also ninja stealth is now stealthily more powerful. 

v3.20.1: Oops
Hotfix for a bug with strong encounter selection skills. You could previously have Temporal Slow, Temporal Anger, and Temporal Rage and get the effects of Temporal Absence. Now you can't (probably). Also, they have tooltips!

v3.20.0: Mage stuff
Finished more mage skills: COMBAT II, NONCOMBAT II (they still need names) and Foresight are now implemented. They may have bugs. 

v3.19.0: Surprise!
Inventors can now Fortify some buildings, doubling ALL production rates (including negative ones). One more mage skill (Mana Frontloading) has been implemented. It's probably pretty buggy. 

v3.18.1:
Fixed a bug where sometimes the logikitten perfect bonus was still in the resource/second change list but not accounted for. You can now get more than 1 carrot seed per prestige. 

v3.18.0: Gardening
Added a new encounter and resource/use for fuel: void. What will it do? Another nerf to CSOP: you need to have a nonzero resources/s for it to give you stuff of each resource. Added some basic gardening. Currently you can grow... 1 carrot per prestige. More seeds will probably be added later. 

v3.17.2:
More slot machine improvements. There's now many more upgrades you can get for it. Still probably not worth playing.

v3.17.1:
Improved the slot machine at the casino. It still probably isn't worth it, but why not try it out and upgrade it a bit? Also decreased the update rate to improve performance.

v3.17.0:
Added a casino you can lose money at. Seriously, the slots have a 2.7% return. Don't play them.

v3.16.2:
Fix CSOP and mana purifier cost (should be 10x what it was). Broken chair can be bought more than once. Reduced free fuel per prestige and fuel required to adventure.

v3.16.1: Purified Mana and More
Unlocking AutoEvents now will actually destroy your shields. You can now construct a mana purifier (if you have a lot of KP). Fixed a bug with AutoEvents always triggering because of blank fields. Fixed a bug with high-level logicat rewards being impossible to get. Oh, and once you get purified mana the hotkey to use it is C.

v3.16.0: Purified Mana and More
There's now some machines that self-replicate on the Abandoned World (not colony). They can give you some good loot. Added purified mana and a building to make it. There's no way to get that building yet though. Added another small starting bonus - if you have 400 or more mana, you start with 1 free fuel. There's some new logikitten rewards too. The perfect cat bonus should now theoretically show up in the tracking tooltips for resources. 

v3.15.3:
Choosing alchemy from the wanderer sucks less (this change will be removed when Alchemist actually gets stuff). Slightly nerfed Chairs Sit on People (you now need some of a resource for it to be set to 1/s). Further nerfed sandcastle prestige value. When bribing, if you have enough mana for a disaster to happen there's an extra message telling you which to bribe (or not bribe). Fixed a weird internal bug that had no effect on gameplay.

v3.15.2:
Nerfed sandcastles a bit because with Chairs Sit on People they're super powerful. Also added code to start getting some data on one of the mage upgrades.

v3.15.1: π breaks stuff.
Having some characters like π in the changelog should no longer break exporting.

v3.15.0: No more π.
Implemented 3 more mage skills: Adventure encounter selectors and a skill to get more stuff from enemies.

v3.14.1(59): Pi
Fixed a bug where perfect logikittens could infinitely stack (due to the wearing off message happening too quickly.) 

v3.14.0: Actual Skill Tree
It's clearer that you'll lose ship parts when you get PC/AutoEvents. The skill tree for Magic option from wanderer is now interactive and skills are buyable. Only some of them work (anything with a non-TODO tooltip).

v3.13.1: Skill Tree
Added a skill tree for the mage. There aren't skills yet, but the tree looks nice. Changed Chronomancy description. Changed how Chairs Sit On People works slightly. Now it's probably even more broken. 

v3.13.0: QoL Update
Fixed small issue with last resource having a border when it wasn't needed. Resources now have a tooltip showing what's modifying them. Note that some sources won't be tracked (and there might be some bugs with it), so please report those as bugs if you find any. Water collector tooltip says exactly how much mana you need. You can bribe politicians without having coal mining (but you should get coal mining first anyways). Added a weird new upgrade and a way to undo it. Wanderer can show up without you doing any adventure mode stuff. Wanderer can be male or female.

v3.12.0:
Made the increased scaling cost of libraries lower. Added a book recycler. Fixed a bug with Mithril Forges not updating KP left. It is past Christmas so you can't get a gift anymore. Steel and Mithril machines now take managers to run (starting from your next prestige). However, there's an upgrade to make Skyscrapers cheaper. Fixed a bug with Panther Rush. 

v3.11.0: Merry Christmas!
Added a giant drill. You can now open your present. Demons now come for you slightly earlier and it shows how much in debt you are there. The logikitten boost for more points now unlocks correctly. Changed a small interaction involving perfect logikittens. Merry Christmas!

v3.10.0: Event Automation
Added event automation. There's an upgrade that lets you get free points from logic puzzles. Your affililiation with demons is shown. Logikittens are logged. 

v3.9.1: The Wanderer
All clouds of dust now lead to the Small Cloud. Added a suggested prestige amount. Getting sludge should work better if you refresh. 

v3.9.0: The Wanderer
Minor CSS fix: You should now be able to easily highlight your purchased upgrades to easily share them. Fixed a bug with bags of holding not opening. New shield available for crafting: mithril plating (requires being an Inventor). Convolution cube now shouldn't do weird things with requiring sludge. 

v3.8.0: The Wanderer
You can forge Mithril now! Well, if you're an inventor. Also fixed a small tooltip bug. 

v3.7.0: The Wanderer
Cath trading has been nerfed. You can now only take each deal once every 10 minutes, so make them count. Choosing Magic or Technology now does stuff! Specifically, a bag of holding (yay, starting bonuses) and two new buildings. You're now more likely to invest in uranium. Your first artifact should actually give the full 1000 refined mana. Fixed a bug in a easter egg "bug" (yes, our bugs even have bugs!) Chronomancy requires more mana. Solar panels generate less fuel after you finish the environmental crisis. Fixed a bug where you could accidentally prestige for infinite mana. Added a new title. NOTE: Bags of holding will be harder to get in the future, however I they're necessary for something I want to implement soon, so they're easy to get now.

v3.6.1: The Wanderer.
Fixed a bug where adventuring in Piscine would sometimes simply not work. Prestige shows % to next mana (kind of, it's an approximation and each subsequent % is harder). Choosing a class with the wanderer gives minor bonuses: Magic makes refined mana twice as effective (before being capped for resources that cap), Alchemy makes potions slightly stronger, and Inventor makes Manufacturing better.

v3.6.0: Environmental Disaster!
When adding fuel, it shows how much you have to add. You can now use libraries to gain knowledge points and use those to reset the cost of libraries. More uses will come soon (TM). New upgrade to make libraries even cheaper (it'll be needed). Convolution cubes now have a different starting state depending on how many you've solved. The wanderer only shows you 2 options out of the 3 possible ones. Environmental and financial crises now happen at alternating amounts of mana. Fixed a bug with getting more sludge after you solved the environmental disaster. Coming soon (maybe): Tracking of what's all increasing/decreasing your resource gains.

v3.5.1: Environmental Disaster!
Fixed a bug where buying some buildings would turn them off, even if you had the production to back them up.

v3.5.0: Environmental Disaster!
Changed Piscine fuel costs to not be more expensive to adventure there than to enter. Also edited cloud maze exit cost and Haven links there instead of directly to Piscine. Fixed a bug with financial collapse fixing where you could get double money from banks for a bit. Added an Environmental Disaster and a way to solve it. Resources you have none of are hidden again. Unbuyable buildings are actually unbuyable. When setting up a rule, you can only have it use resources you have. Some buildings now cost less, some buildings can now give a percent gain to resources (only applied to net /s if it's positive). Fixed a couple bugs with the Convolution Cube (and some balance changes.) The Wanderer can now teach you. There isn't anything really once you've learned a subject, but that will be added later. Added some hotkeys: ESC or X to close events and adventure mode, 0-9 to choose event (and I guess adventure) options, F to force event, T to speed/slow time, R to refine mana, +/- to change Thaumaturgic converter level, and A to adventure. Added a Christmas present. Added a new title. Oh, also you'll probably need to prestige. I'm sorry.

v3.4.1+:
Please make sure you prestige within the next week! New stuff is coming out that will make it impossible to progress in your current prestige if you don't!

v3.4.1:
Upgrading carrots is now more expensive. You now need to know some alchemy before you can unlock Production Control (mostly for checking later on stuff easier). Potions of Space Sight now don't let you get ridiculous amounts of fuel when combined with speed time. Carrots are harder to find. Having Chronomancy can sometimes make events more common.

v3.4.0:
Oh yeah, also forgot to add resource multipliers. That will also be used later, so make sure you prestige sometime within the next month or so. And now I can't actually forget to update the version number as it's automatic. Also fixed a bug where speed time + energy buildings would turn off the energy buildings. There's also a new event. It doesn't do anything yet, but it's planned.

v3.3.0:
A bit more flavor text for machines, some backend stuff that will be used later (just want it so people will have prestiged by the time it's used). Added a new boost to use time quicker (and if you have it time will also speed up the early stages of financial collapse). Oh, also added some code to check if you're on a new version!

v3.2.1:
Okay, you can actually get to the abandoned planet. Yay!

v3.2.0:
There's a new world with not much. You can get rules unlocked there, but that unlock will probably be pushed back a bit in the future. Fixed strobe mode a bit. Also added a new style - Christmas Lights!

v3.1.2+:
Potions of Burninating now will not melt you far into the negatives. As fun as it may have been, it can't last. Mountains and Forests aren't so powerful. Also, fixed a bunch of capitalization issues with upgrade names. Also, added production control (in testing, not available from normal play yet. Put $("#pc_box").parent().removeClass("hidden"); into the console to unlock it temporarily, tell me what you think!)

v3.1.1:
Slight prestige formula changes. Also added 6 more mana start buildings and moved one to be earlier. 

v3.1.0:
Hydrogen engines generate more energy and can be upgraded to be net neutral. Mines and logging camps cost less, and there's an upgrade to further reduce the price. It's slightly easier to get mana. Buildings now produce resource /s instead of resource per second. 3 new titles. Having mana gives you some buildings on prestige. Also fixed some bugs with the trading portal and fixed the tooltip.

v3.0.1:
The long-awaited upgrade fix! Should fix the strange issue where clicking an upgrade wouldn't buy it sometimes. Also, costs you can't pay are colored red now.

v3.0.0:
Turkeys have disappeared. You ate them all. The buff helps you in combat now too! Oh, you can also brew potions.

v2.17.0:
You can fight wild turkeys! Get some turkey legs! Bugfixes and improvements: Hydrogen mines should show the correct amount after prestige. When logikitten perfect buff runs out it says so in the log. Fixed an issue where you never got the option to end the financial crisis. 

v2.16.2:
Clouds of dust now tell you their own state if they're on and didn't change. Bottles are harder to get but worth more. Fixed a bug with demon trading. 

v2.16.1:
Favicon now changes when there's an event.

v2.16.0:
You can now visit the homeworld of the sharks, Haven. What do they have to teach you? Will you become a master alchemist? Well, at least you can manage your buildings better now. Quite useful, actually. Also fixed a bug with Magic Orb (energy) not giving energy but taking it. Made a blatantly overpowered potion that you won't get, but is a useful test for alchemy potions doing things.

v2.15.4:
Groupings now kind of work, they just need to be saved. Demons no longer trade a negative amount of diamonds. 

v2.15.3:
Hydrogen mines should carry over between prestiges. This is untested, but hopefully it works. The gray button on the convolution cube should actually work properly now. Financial crisis has had the balance changed. 

v2.15.2:
Prestige no longer breaks in middle of button if your window is too small. Same for all off/all on buttons. Setting to strobe now gives a warning. The "saved" notification was moved a bit. Started work on better building management. Fixed a couple issues with the convolution cube.

v2.15.1:
Fixed bug where ghostly lever would add half your points instead of subtract it.

v2.15.0:
What you've all been waiting for - strobe theme!

v2.14.4:
Small bugfix with convolution cube.

v2.14.3:
Added image for Sandpaper. Demons taking resources should have the amount formatted now. You can now only get 1 production boost from logikittens. Special resources have the line under them colored. 

v2.14.2:
Really small update here. Finished the cube, changed a few things that could let you get stuck, and made the event window scroll better.

v2.14.1:
Resources now have a line under them. It should help with seeing your /s better. The convolution cube is almost fully implemented. (If solving it turns out to be impossible, tell me because that's important)

v2.14.0:
Logikittens now no longer have statements in the form of Exactly one of Statement A and Statement A is true/false. They also tell you what level you are. And there's a new reward from them, which isn't fully implemented yet.

v2.13.1:
Flux Capacitor generates slightly less time. Fixing a financial crisis now sets your money/s back to what it should be. Special resources are once again properly colored. 

v2.13.0:
Added a financial crisis that happens. If you can survive it, you'll come out stronger than before. Good luck.

v2.12.3:
Maybe fix logicats perfect stuff? Hopefully it doesn't break everything. Resources don't have extra decimals (oops).

v2.12.2:
Bugfixes: you can turn on buildings that get you money even if you have negative money. You can also see negative money. You can no longer go into debt to bribe. You can adventure if you have no fuel, but your ship does.

v2.12.1:
Changed PRNG function, so logicat reward order changed again. 

v2.12.0:
Gas cloud puzzle has messages better randomized. There's a new weapon you can make. Boom!

v2.11.1:
The prestige button should now show mana gained on prestige.

v2.11.0:
Added a Flux Capacitor. Fixed a typo with the logging upgrade. Spooky lights are now gone (until next year, if I remember to turn them on).

v2.10.1:
All NaN amounts of resources should automatically be set back to 0. Unless you have NaN generators, in which case you need help.

v2.10.0:
Piscine encounter says there's nothing else when there's nothing else (more may be added later!), but it now connects to a puzzle/maze area. See if you can get to the end. Added something to have some encounters able to appear anywhere, but nothing uses it yet. Some items can be used for various benefits. There's new titles that can appear. 

v2.9.2:
Added spooky lights.

v2.9.1:
Unlocking science at Piscine now works slightly better. You should no longer be able to build sandcastles and then buy upgrades again. 

v2.9.0:
Added Piscine encounter that lets you learn Science! Added new engine which isn't super useful yet, but will be with some weapons (not yet added). 

v2.8.0:
Umbra now has a reward for throwing stuff away. Added glass bottles (which you can't get yet). Spoopy link to something added. You can go to Piscine, but you can't do stuff there. Loading with a workshop that's on under some conditions no longer breaks your game. Logicats now give most boosts through levels (this DOES mess up the ordering, so find the new order of what each level gives.)

v2.7.1:
Small bugfixes: you now actually need 50 mana to get steel beams and can't cheat by spamming to keep buildings on. Refined mana now can warp fractions of any resource in. So you won't get 1 castle per warp.

v2.7.0:
Smurf encounter isn't missing a newline. You can get sandcastles. Glass value increased, but it takes more sand to smelt glass. You can use sand to buy sandcastles. Meteors give more stone and gold. Logicat levels do things. Each level gives a reward. The reward progression is deterministic, but the pattern may change if I add more rewards.

v2.6.0:
When adventuring, you have less of a chance of finding a logikitten now. In terminus, the freezing noncombat is less likely. Fixed a bug with upgrades that give buildings potentially giving none. Logikittens now say what rewards you got. 

v2.5.1:
Logikittens don't give energy/mana/similar. 

v2.5.0:
Added new adventure mode location. Umbra has a new adventure that expands ship storage. Your first event after reload appears sooner if you have the upgrade that does it. You can find cute kittens while you're there and they give rewards for solving puzzles.

v2.4.1:
Umbra encounter now doesn't let you get NaN fuel, re-adventuring in a place should turn red if you don't have enough fuel. 

v2.4.0:
New umbra encounter (throw some stuff away), oil well upgrades no longer check production of oil wells, mana gain power reduced (but not as much as raised, so still a bit higher), embezzling gives more stuff (may still not be enough, but yay uranium!), eregs boosts oil wells. Also started work on new event, use force_event(10) in the console to try it out (not interactive yet, but it's coming soon, unlocked by adventure mode!)

v2.3.2:
Mana is slightly easier to get. Time now is used up faster. You can see a few mana buildings ahead maybe. Factory is once again at 50 mana.

v2.3.1:
Investments should have proper sigfigs, bribing a politician shows up earlier and tells you that you need banks. Trade portal tells you that unused mana helps it, time rewind no longer has an inaccurate tooltip.

v2.3.0:
New location: Umbra. Also there's a mysterious warpgate. Also adventuring should be less laggy. 

v2.2.3:
Tooltips now have the proper background color, positive resources will now not be red. 

v2.2.2:
Shield images now have transparent background. Light theme secondary color is lighter. Workshop menu changes with theme.

v2.2.1:
Ice giant should be more common. Hydrogen mines should build one, not 2 and give proper /s generation. You can now switch from the dark theme to an even worse light theme.

v2.2.0:
Changelog renamed (Technomancy instead of Crappy Incremental). Add new hopefully not broken ice giant encounter. Unbuyable buildings now say so.

v2.1.1:
You can now actually get hydrogen from the moon encounter (bug fixed), gold sifters use less stone, printing press upgrade text is fixed, resources with negative values use the positive version in prestige.

v2.1.0:
You can now buy iron ore at Cath. Add two library upgrades. Destroying buildings refunds 30% of the build cost. Setting to buy multiple actually updates tooltops properly. Removing fuel says "Remove" instead of "Add". You can make machine parts and build mines on the moon. Making more small lasers is now harder and equally useless.

v2.0.1:
Space squid rewards you on killing it. It has a slightly different AI now too. Also winning/losing fights is better. 

v2.0.0:
Adventure mode! A total of 4 locations available to explore! A dazzling space squid to fight! Also a boring bugfix with fuel generation. 

v1.18.2:
Nothing shows in the /s area if you're getting 0/s, if it's negative it shows up red. 

v1.18.1:
Add upgrade for more common events. Investments now gain much more money. Artifacts give more refined mana but it decreases over time. Demons give you more stuff. Workshop bar now changes color depending on if it is working or not.

v1.18.0:
Time rewind costs more mana. Added upgrade to make time rewind cheaper. Reduced bribing mana cost back to what it was. Uranium upgrades now take having 200 mana to show up.

v1.17.2:
Coal mines now no longe take more coal than you can initially see them with.

v1.17.1:
Fuel making now takes even more research.

v1.17.0:
Politician bribing is harder. Lots of balance changes: factory takes 75 mana, mines and logging camps are slightly more expensive, furnaces cost more money, gold sifters cost more, oil wells cost more stone and produce less oil, book printers cost more, most end-game buildings have cost increases along with virtually every upgrade. Added oil well upgrades. Mana division rate is harsher.

v1.16.1:
Added notification to export.

v1.16.0:
New wiki link added, solar panel added.

Doubled mana value, titles change 10x less often.

v1.15.7:
Removed link to the wiki. It was horribly out of date.

v1.15.6:
Bugfixes: Time speed turns off visibly when you run out of time. You can't spam click mana buildings to use them. You can't force an event when you have one. Energy converter is clearer about costs.

v1.15.5:
Slight fix for rapidly changing values. Now resource values are better shown.

v1.15.4:
Slight endgame change. Framework set up for me to actually maybe make adventuring a thing soon.

Small numbers should show properly. Building costs are now formatted.

v1.15.2:

Fuel maker now uses refined mana as it should.

v1.13.0:
You can now use uranium to make fuel! Mana refinery moved to above greed as it can cost less. Workshop renamed to Manufacturing. Mana now caps trades much quicker. With both upgrades, you can still get steel beams. You need a ton of mana to bribe politicians.

v1.12.0:
Event box is now more annoying (it scrolls with you). Nuclear reactor added. Steel is worth more. Added uranium for your reactors. Trading portal upgrades are more expensive. Total upgrades no longer show. Slight prestige formula fix.

v1.11.0:
Go bribe some politicians now. It can do things.

v1.10.2:
Energy boost starts at a default of 1 instead of 2. Logging camp upgrade takes >= 5 mana instead of > 5. Bank upgrade takes >= 20 instead of > 20. You can actually gain more than 6 mana (reduction of >50 gains were mistakenly applied too early.) Rickrolling autoplays once per prestige now.

v1.10.1:

v1.10.0:
Added an option to force events. Demons now punish being greedy. Trading upgrades nerfed.

Randomly generated events! You can now hit it rich on the stock market! Also added tooltip for purchased upgrades.

v0.6.3:
Tooltip bugfix with upgrades.

v0.6.2:
