Technomancy Changelog

v3.5.1: Environmental Disaster!
Fixed a bug where buying some buildings would turn them off, even if you had the production to back them up.

v3.5.0: Environmental Disaster!
Changed Piscine fuel costs to not be more expensive to adventure there than to enter. Also edited cloud maze exit cost and Haven links there instead of directly to Piscine. Fixed a bug with financial collapse fixing where you could get double money from banks for a bit. Added an Environmental Disaster and a way to solve it. Resources you have none of are hidden again. Unbuyable buildings are actually unbuyable. When setting up a rule, you can only have it use resources you have. Some buildings now cost less, some buildings can now give a percent gain to resources (only applied to net /s if it's positive). Fixed a couple bugs with the Convolution Cube (and some balance changes.) The Wanderer can now teach you. There isn't anything really once you've learned a subject, but that will be added later. Added some hotkeys: ESC or X to close events and adventure mode, 0-9 to choose event (and I guess adventure) options, F to force event, T to speed/slow time, R to refine mana, +/- to change Thaumaturgic converter level, and A to adventure. Added a Christmas present. Added a new title. Oh, also you'll probably need to prestige. I'm sorry.

v3.4.1+:
Please make sure you prestige within the next week! New stuff is coming out that will make it impossible to progress in your current prestige if you don't!

v3.4.1:
Upgrading carrots is now more expensive. You now need to know some alchemy before you can unlock Production Control (mostly for checking later on stuff easier). Potions of Space Sight now don't let you get ridiculous amounts of fuel when combined with speed time. Carrots are harder to find. Having Chronomancy can sometimes make events more common.

v3.4.0:
Oh yeah, also forgot to add resource multipliers. That will also be used later, so make sure you prestige sometime within the next month or so. And now I can't actually forget to update the version number as it's automatic. Also fixed a bug where speed time + energy buildings would turn off the energy buildings. There's also a new event. It doesn't do anything yet, but it's planned.

v3.3.0:
A bit more flavor text for machines, some backend stuff that will be used later (just want it so people will have prestiged by the time it's used). Added a new boost to use time quicker (and if you have it time will also speed up the early stages of financial collapse). Oh, also added some code to check if you're on a new version!

v3.2.1:
Okay, you can actually get to the abandoned planet. Yay!

v3.2.0:
There's a new world with not much. You can get rules unlocked there, but that unlock will probably be pushed back a bit in the future. Fixed strobe mode a bit. Also added a new style - Christmas Lights!

v3.1.2+:
Potions of Burninating now will not melt you far into the negatives. As fun as it may have been, it can't last. Mountains and Forests aren't so powerful. Also, fixed a bunch of capitalization issues with upgrade names. Also, added production control (in testing, not available from normal play yet. Put $("#pc_box").parent().removeClass("hidden"); into the console to unlock it temporarily, tell me what you think!)

v3.1.1:
Slight prestige formula changes. Also added 6 more mana start buildings and moved one to be earlier. 

v3.1.0:
Hydrogen engines generate more energy and can be upgraded to be net neutral. Mines and logging camps cost less, and there's an upgrade to further reduce the price. It's slightly easier to get mana. Buildings now produce resource /s instead of resource per second. 3 new titles. Having mana gives you some buildings on prestige. Also fixed some bugs with the trading portal and fixed the tooltip.

v3.0.1:
The long-awaited upgrade fix! Should fix the strange issue where clicking an upgrade wouldn't buy it sometimes. Also, costs you can't pay are colored red now.

v3.0.0:
Turkeys have disappeared. You ate them all. The buff helps you in combat now too! Oh, you can also brew potions.

v2.17.0:
You can fight wild turkeys! Get some turkey legs! Bugfixes and improvements: Hydrogen mines should show the correct amount after prestige. When logikitten perfect buff runs out it says so in the log. Fixed an issue where you never got the option to end the financial crisis. 

v2.16.2:
Clouds of dust now tell you their own state if they're on and didn't change. Bottles are harder to get but worth more. Fixed a bug with demon trading. 

v2.16.1:
Favicon now changes when there's an event.

v2.16.0:
You can now visit the homeworld of the sharks, Haven. What do they have to teach you? Will you become a master alchemist? Well, at least you can manage your buildings better now. Quite useful, actually. Also fixed a bug with Magic Orb (energy) not giving energy but taking it. Made a blatantly overpowered potion that you won't get, but is a useful test for alchemy potions doing things.

v2.15.4:
Groupings now kind of work, they just need to be saved. Demons no longer trade a negative amount of diamonds. 

v2.15.3:
Hydrogen mines should carry over between prestiges. This is untested, but hopefully it works. The gray button on the convolution cube should actually work properly now. Financial crisis has had the balance changed. 

v2.15.2:
Prestige no longer breaks in middle of button if your window is too small. Same for all off/all on buttons. Setting to strobe now gives a warning. The "saved" notification was moved a bit. Started work on better building management. Fixed a couple issues with the convolution cube.

v2.15.1:
Fixed bug where ghostly lever would add half your points instead of subtract it.

v2.15.0:
What you've all been waiting for - strobe theme!

v2.14.4:
Small bugfix with convolution cube.

v2.14.3:
Added image for Sandpaper. Demons taking resources should have the amount formatted now. You can now only get 1 production boost from logikittens. Special resources have the line under them colored. 

v2.14.2:
Really small update here. Finished the cube, changed a few things that could let you get stuck, and made the event window scroll better.

v2.14.1:
Resources now have a line under them. It should help with seeing your /s better. The convolution cube is almost fully implemented. (If solving it turns out to be impossible, tell me because that's important)

v2.14.0:
Logikittens now no longer have statements in the form of Exactly one of Statement A and Statement A is true/false. They also tell you what level you are. And there's a new reward from them, which isn't fully implemented yet.

v2.13.1:
Flux Capacitor generates slightly less time. Fixing a financial crisis now sets your money/s back to what it should be. Special resources are once again properly colored. 

v2.13.0:
Added a financial crisis that happens. If you can survive it, you'll come out stronger than before. Good luck.

v2.12.3:
Maybe fix logicats perfect stuff? Hopefully it doesn't break everything. Resources don't have extra decimals (oops).

v2.12.2:
Bugfixes: you can turn on buildings that get you money even if you have negative money. You can also see negative money. You can no longer go into debt to bribe. You can adventure if you have no fuel, but your ship does.

v2.12.1:
Changed PRNG function, so logicat reward order changed again. 

v2.12.0:
Gas cloud puzzle has messages better randomized. There's a new weapon you can make. Boom!

v2.11.1:
The prestige button should now show mana gained on prestige.

v2.11.0:
Added a Flux Capacitor. Fixed a typo with the logging upgrade. Spooky lights are now gone (until next year, if I remember to turn them on).

v2.10.1:
All NaN amounts of resources should automatically be set back to 0. Unless you have NaN generators, in which case you need help.

v2.10.0:
Piscine encounter says there's nothing else when there's nothing else (more may be added later!), but it now connects to a puzzle/maze area. See if you can get to the end. Added something to have some encounters able to appear anywhere, but nothing uses it yet. Some items can be used for various benefits. There's new titles that can appear. 

v2.9.2:
Added spooky lights.

v2.9.1:
Unlocking science at Piscine now works slightly better. You should no longer be able to build sandcastles and then buy upgrades again. 

v2.9.0:
Added Piscine encounter that lets you learn Science! Added new engine which isn't super useful yet, but will be with some weapons (not yet added). 

v2.8.0:
Umbra now has a reward for throwing stuff away. Added glass bottles (which you can't get yet). Spoopy link to something added. You can go to Piscine, but you can't do stuff there. Loading with a workshop that's on under some conditions no longer breaks your game. Logicats now give most boosts through levels (this DOES mess up the ordering, so find the new order of what each level gives.)

v2.7.1:
Small bugfixes: you now actually need 50 mana to get steel beams and can't cheat by spamming to keep buildings on. Refined mana now can warp fractions of any resource in. So you won't get 1 castle per warp.

v2.7.0:
Smurf encounter isn't missing a newline. You can get sandcastles. Glass value increased, but it takes more sand to smelt glass. You can use sand to buy sandcastles. Meteors give more stone and gold. Logicat levels do things. Each level gives a reward. The reward progression is deterministic, but the pattern may change if I add more rewards.

v2.6.0:
When adventuring, you have less of a chance of finding a logikitten now. In terminus, the freezing noncombat is less likely. Fixed a bug with upgrades that give buildings potentially giving none. Logikittens now say what rewards you got. 

v2.5.1:
Logikittens don't give energy/mana/similar. 

v2.5.0:
Added new adventure mode location. Umbra has a new adventure that expands ship storage. Your first event after reload appears sooner if you have the upgrade that does it. You can find cute kittens while you're there and they give rewards for solving puzzles.

v2.4.1:
Umbra encounter now doesn't let you get NaN fuel, re-adventuring in a place should turn red if you don't have enough fuel. 

v2.4.0:
New umbra encounter (throw some stuff away), oil well upgrades no longer check production of oil wells, mana gain power reduced (but not as much as raised, so still a bit higher), embezzling gives more stuff (may still not be enough, but yay uranium!), eregs boosts oil wells. Also started work on new event, use force_event(10) in the console to try it out (not interactive yet, but it's coming soon, unlocked by adventure mode!)

v2.3.2:
Mana is slightly easier to get. Time now is used up faster. You can see a few mana buildings ahead maybe. Factory is once again at 50 mana.

v2.3.1:
Investments should have proper sigfigs, bribing a politician shows up earlier and tells you that you need banks. Trade portal tells you that unused mana helps it, time rewind no longer has an inaccurate tooltip.

v2.3.0:
New location: Umbra. Also there's a mysterious warpgate. Also adventuring should be less laggy. 

v2.2.3:
Tooltips now have the proper background color, positive resources will now not be red. 

v2.2.2:
Shield images now have transparent background. Light theme secondary color is lighter. Workshop menu changes with theme.

v2.2.1:
Ice giant should be more common. Hydrogen mines should build one, not 2 and give proper /s generation. You can now switch from the dark theme to an even worse light theme.

v2.2.0:
Changelog renamed (Technomancy instead of Crappy Incremental). Add new hopefully not broken ice giant encounter. Unbuyable buildings now say so.

v2.1.1:
You can now actually get hydrogen from the moon encounter (bug fixed), gold sifters use less stone, printing press upgrade text is fixed, resources with negative values use the positive version in prestige.

v2.1.0:
You can now buy iron ore at Cath. Add two library upgrades. Destroying buildings refunds 30% of the build cost. Setting to buy multiple actually updates tooltops properly. Removing fuel says "Remove" instead of "Add". You can make machine parts and build mines on the moon. Making more small lasers is now harder and equally useless.

v2.0.1:
Space squid rewards you on killing it. It has a slightly different AI now too. Also winning/losing fights is better. 

v2.0.0:
Adventure mode! A total of 4 locations available to explore! A dazzling space squid to fight! Also a boring bugfix with fuel generation. 

v1.18.2:
Nothing shows in the /s area if you're getting 0/s, if it's negative it shows up red. 

v1.18.1:
Add upgrade for more common events. Investments now gain much more money. Artifacts give more refined mana but it decreases over time. Demons give you more stuff. Workshop bar now changes color depending on if it is working or not.

v1.18.0:
Time rewind costs more mana. Added upgrade to make time rewind cheaper. Reduced bribing mana cost back to what it was. Uranium upgrades now take having 200 mana to show up.

v1.17.2:
Coal mines now no longe take more coal than you can initially see them with.

v1.17.1:
Fuel making now takes even more research.

v1.17.0:
Politician bribing is harder. Lots of balance changes: factory takes 75 mana, mines and logging camps are slightly more expensive, furnaces cost more money, gold sifters cost more, oil wells cost more stone and produce less oil, book printers cost more, most end-game buildings have cost increases along with virtually every upgrade. Added oil well upgrades. Mana division rate is harsher.

v1.16.1:
Added notification to export.

v1.16.0:
New wiki link added, solar panel added.

v1.15.9:
You can now invest in antique items, you can't invest in rugs, meteors give more energy and potentially uranium.

v1.15.8:
Doubled mana value, titles change 10x less often.

v1.15.7:
Removed link to the wiki. It was horribly out of date.

v1.15.6:

v1.15.4:

Small numbers should show properly. Building costs are now formatted.

v1.15.2:

Fuel maker now uses refined mana as it should.

v1.13.0:
You can now use uranium to make fuel! Mana refinery moved to above greed as it can cost less. Workshop renamed to Manufacturing. Mana now caps trades much quicker. With both upgrades, you can still get steel beams. You need a ton of mana to bribe politicians.

v1.12.0:
Event box is now more annoying (it scrolls with you). Nuclear reactor added. Steel is worth more. Added uranium for your reactors. Trading portal upgrades are more expensive. Total upgrades no longer show. Slight prestige formula fix.

v1.11.0:
Go bribe some politicians now. It can do things.

v1.10.2:
Energy boost starts at a default of 1 instead of 2. Logging camp upgrade takes >= 5 mana instead of > 5. Bank upgrade takes >= 20 instead of > 20. You can actually gain more than 6 mana (reduction of >50 gains were mistakenly applied too early.) Rickrolling autoplays once per prestige now.

v1.10.1:

v1.10.0:
Added an option to force events. Demons now punish being greedy. Trading upgrades nerfed.

v1.9.0:

Water purifier hints that prestige is required. Total upgrades now shows the actual number, not one higher.

v1.0.1:
Coal mining tooltip now properly reflects not needing research. Energy/research generation no longer says per second. Events now happen much less often (as they should have, I missed a 0) and investing gives a slight range.

Randomly generated events! You can now hit it rich on the stock market! Also added tooltip for purchased upgrades.

v0.6.3:
Tooltip bugfix with upgrades.

v0.6.2:
