Technomancy Changelog

v6.0.5: (5/7/2020) Even more bug fixes
The strange key should now actually appear to buy, if you want it.

v6.0.4: (5/6/2020) Yes more bugs
You can now unlock the gates if you have any of the keys, not just two specific ones. Fix some stuff with acquiring the key at the casino.

v6.0.3: (5/6/2020) More fixes
Hopefully made casino chances better (maybe possible?) and fix currency information. Finish up the last couple sorceror skills. Hopefully it's all working now.

v6.0.2: (5/6/2020) More bugfixes
You can now sacrifice yourself, if you really want to. Also, QoL: you can see your key progress at the casino.

v6.0.1: (5/6/2020) Bugfix
Fix a bug that allowed quick mana to unlock the final spell way too early.

v6.0.0: (5/5/2020) End of the Game
Added content to finish the game. Buy a star chart at the black market of Cath. Pass the 4 Gates and receive a reward for it. Also clarify what happens after you choose a class.

v5.24.2: (2/22/2020) More ascension issues
You can now actually beat floors when past written ascension. 

v5.24.1: (2/21/2020) Fix tower ascension issues
You can now ascend when at the max tower level. Oops, thought I had changed that already but I guess not.

v5.24.0: (2/20/2020) Huh, neat date
The seals now let you get back to Ulgathor, if you cared. Changed a ton of code internally for how the tower works, hopefully nothing is too broken. Ascensions are now uncapped - climb as high as you want. Added Ascension burning: why keep grinding such hard of ascensions when a lower level one would be much easier? Well, now's your opportunity. There's a new location with high-value upgrades to be purchased for ascension levels. Note that the stock of items IS limited, so don't go too crazy with ascending as only so many can be burned. 

v5.23.18: (11/10/19) I'm not dead
You can no longer put anything in your magic bag if you have instant mana. Also, this is the first use of the dev branch!

v5.23.17: (6/5/19) Hopefully actually fix file stuff
So apparently it wasn't getting compiled in. Also, for updates after this I might try to have a dev branch somewhere else and only push to the main game when it's stable. Yay!

v5.23.16: (5/22/19) More minor bugfixes
Also finish save/load to/from file.

v5.23.15: (5/22/19) More minor bugfixes
Fixed a weird bug with convolution cube. Logicat bonus is removed from tooltips when it should be.

v5.23.14: (4/24/19) More minor bugfixes
Hopefully fix an issue on Mac where alternate fonts mess things up. Hydrogen is worth even less in UDM, along with a couple other tweaks to the prestige formula. Time saved on prestige is slightly less now (specifically, it's lessened by the amount of time you get on prestige.) Fixed some challenge descriptions. Wanderer II doesn't let you double as much as you want anymore. You can't refine negative amounts of mana. The entrance to the tower tells you what ascension you're on. Added new bugs, probably.

v5.23.13: (4/3/19) Minor bugfixes
You can now bribe a politician with 5 strip mines. Also, if you need more money when trying to bribe, it tells you that. Meteor event and wanderer II should now both work with AutoEvents.

v5.23.12: (4/1/19) No more ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
But who IS spooky lenny? And WHY does he eat?

v5.23.11: (4/1/19) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

v5.23.10: (3/22/19) Final update for a week, probably
Keyboard shortcuts should work with mixed button/clickables now. Tooltips should read properly with a screen reader for real this time. Added roles for non-buyable buildings. Workshop/enchanting progress bar now also says what % it is completed.

v5.23.9: (3/21/19) More screen reader support, minor bugfix
Fixed a bug where you could start challenges with mana. Essence is now hidden until you unlock it. Fixed some stuff with tooltips not reading properly for a screen reader. All buyable buildings are now aria buttons, but unbuyable buildings and spells have no role yet.

v5.23.8: (3/21/19) Start adding more screen reader support
Buildings should now be properly described in a screen reader. Changed the buttons to destroy buildings and turn them on/off to actual buttons. The first few buttons to destroy a building should now have ARIA labels for that. If that works, the rest will have it added.

v5.23.7: (3/21/19) Testing for screen reader support
Banks should actually now be described by their tooltip?

v5.23.6: (3/21/19) Testing for screen reader support
Banks should now be described by their tooltip?

v5.23.5: (3/17/19) Bugfixes
Fixed some issues with alchemist ingredients not showing up. Also, when you unlock them it should say where you can find them. You now also need to know alchemy before you can become an Alchemist. Essence compressor now works even if you don't have omega upgrades unlocked. If you have small tower entries banked, it now says how long until the next one is available.

v5.23.4: (3/7/19) More fixes
And another UDM description fi. 

v5.23.3: (3/7/19) Minor cost fix
Fixed a bug where some of the costs for things were 1000x less than they should be. Also, fixed the UDM description.

v5.23.2: (3/6/19) More small fixes
UDM challenge is actually a thing you can start now. The magic bag holds less of special resources in a challenge.

v5.23.1: (3/6/19) Well that was fast
Changed... pretty much all the seal requirements. Added rewards for the 3 minute challenge and UDM challenge. Omnivision helps with the cube. 

v5.23.0: (3/6/19) Another tower Ascension!
Added a new adventure location, accessed by finishing the next ascension. Other rewards include more omega upgrades (because of course that's what you needed) and an upgrade to the purifier.

v5.22.4: (3/5/19) Minor balance change and typo fixes
Fixed a typo in Terminus. You no longer need 10 KP for building fortification to appear as an Inventory (you'll still need it to actually forfity). Beachball mana requirement greatly reduced. Fixed a weird bug with double mana mode and quickmana. Strobe challenge now gives a reward. 

v5.22.3: (2/13/19) Interesting Alchemist Stuff
Fixed a bug where you couldn't adventure some places if you were an alchemist, but hadn't yet learned about alchemy. Changed the 15 minute challenge to 3 minutes. And you need to get more mana in it (it's still impossible to complete though). Increased the value of Void. The 3 minute challenge should now say how long your prestige has been. Reduced the amount of extra hydrogen engines allowed in challenges from the Meteor completion. Fixed a bug where you could spend all your essence, making it impossible to get back to the tower and get more essence. Oops.

v5.21.2: (2/4/19) Minor fixes
AutoUpgrade no longer attempts to buy upgrades you can't afford, probably. There's a bit of placeholder text in the scratchpad. Please don't store important information there though. Switched up some stuff with how high level tower bosses do special attacks. It should fix some weird stuff with spikey kneepads.

v5.21.1: (2/3/19) Small RNG bug
Fixed a bug where some cases of randomly generating numbers would only produce values divisible by 7.

v5.21.0: (2/3/19) Tower goes to floor 50 now!
The moon encounter now gives a hint that you want machine parts there. Added 1 time as a cost to a few upgrades. Changed some of the prestige formula (this mostly affects high-level play with quickmana and a high tower level). Changed bribing a politician event to show up even if you don't have investment companies, but you'll still need them to proceed. Added an event that lets you trade insane amounts of refined mana for resources. Added another tower ascension! This has a lot of neat things! AutoUpgrade, a new challenge, and improved autobuild! 

v5.20.2: (1/28/19)
If you're in a challenge, you no longer get your essence always set to 100, it's now CAPPED at 100 (10 if you're in the UDM challenge, which will be a thing later).

v5.20.1: (1/28/19) Way too many minor things, and setting up for some new content.
Mars is now always visible, and still a pain to get to. Nerfed Cath trading to a shadow of what it once was. Added a couple new challenges, which aren't available yet (unless you enter them with console commands). Buffed gold leaf potions. Increased fuel and uranium value. Increased magnet multipliers. Fixed a bug where you could prestige for infinite mana. You now can truly not prestige in a loan challenge. The scratchpad should appear in challenges too. In settings, F hotkey now properly says what it does. You can no longer purchase essence in a challenge (and essence is limited). In the meteor challenge, you now get to at least get something from the meteor event after it crushes your hopes and dreams. 

v5.20.0: (1/26/19) Scratch that
Added the scratchpad, a persistent text field available at 200+ mana that persists across prestiges, useful for storing adventure notes! Also, fixed a slight issue with enemies reacting immediately instead of waiting 1 second.

v5.19.0: (1/25/19) The Potioning
Added a few new potions for the Alchemist. Also, since there's some real content there, you can no longer back out once you choose it. Reduced the required time amount for Chronomancy to show up. You can actually get Chairs Sit on People again. Fixed a bug with mage quickmana and purchasing essence. The new event granted by tower Ascension IV should actually show up now without jumping through weird hoops. 

v5.18.2: (1/24/18) QoL changes and bugfixes
Fortifying a building should properly update the tooltip. Potions should now appear in the resource tooltip. In fact, everything *should*, so if you notice something that doesn't, it's a bug. Nerfed CSOP a bit more again (and fixed the <500 mana text). Removed gardening (it was bad and buggy). The traveler now says where you can do stuff with your chosen class. Fixed a bug where you couldn't get steel beams as a trade item. The tower of grinding no longer takes a mana per floor.

v5.18.2: (1/16/19) More bugfixes
Removed a bunch of flavor text that's impossible to see. This should reduce save sizes a bit. Environmental cleanup appears much sooner, but can't be bought until you reach the sludge requirement. AI takes less sand per sandcastle (10m instead of 50m). Having a hydrogen machine should no longer break the game on prestige. Enchanting table no longer gives negative bonuses if you don't have much of the required resource. You should no longer be able to get 2 omega machines from the tower.

v5.18.1: (1/15/19) The obligatory bugfixes
Purchasing the new upgrades should actually update the cost of mana to run your AI (also, the second one actually increases the mana cost now too). Beachball functions correctly now. Sandcastle tooltip is correctly placed. The NUKE button works better, and brings you slightly higher. Also, you can no longer get a reward from the next ascension from defeating the last boss of the current one. And since last version should have been 5.18.0 instead of 5.17.5, I updated the version number to be correct.

v5.17.5: (1/14/19) Ascension IV
Reduced essence hyperlooping cost (and hopefully fixed some issues with upgrades to increase essence power). Completely changed Chairs Sit on People to not be a pain anymore. Added a new AI upgrade (well, 2 actually). Made the "Tree Fiddy" event much less common. Added a new logicat reward that should start puzzles with the correct answer already put in. Added a new event. Lightened the color of Time. Added tower Ascension IV (sorry, for those of you that like pineapple on pizza. I personally have nothing against it but it's a good joke). 

v5.16.4: (1/12/19) This one too
Yeah, you can now no longer remove negative fuel from your ship also. What a surprise.

v5.16.3: (1/12/19) Bugfixes
You can no longer add negative fuel to your ship. Tooltips show up in a slightly different place now (so they shouldn't go off the screen).

v5.16.2: (1/7/19) QoL stuff, bugfixes
Powder-based potions should provide sandcastles based on time rather than entered combats. Fixed Omega Machine flavor text. Fixed autobuild breaking the game if you had speed time on. Added a list of hotkeys to the settings menu.

v5.16.1: (1/6/19) Bugfix
The new starchart should now actually show up at Cath.

v5.16.0: (1/6/19) Omegas
Fixed changelog from last time to say 2019 instead of 18. Added 2 new locations in adventure mode! Buy the new map in Cath after defeating enough bosses in tower ascension III. Also added a new building: the Omega machine. For those of you with negative essence, you can now re-examine your christmas present to get some again. Also fixed a bug that let you buy negative amounts of adventure power (and get an essence refund!)

v5.15.3: (1/2/19) First update since last year
Fixed a bug where fortifying a building wouldn't update anything until reload. You can no longer get the 2018 Christmas present, if you didn't already. Fixed a bug where one tower reward (floor 35) would disappear on prestige. Also, it's a bit late but in celebration of international nerf day, mana is capped at 100k when you start a prestige. If you'd be above that, you're now at 100k. Sorry. Also, some high value resources can no longer be placed in the bag of folding. 

v5.15.2: (12/24/18) Merry Christmas (It's Christmas somewhere!)
Fixed a weird bug with mage combat/noncombat forcing. Small loan now correctly says you go to 100 mana, not 0. You can now use the 2018 Christmas present! Also, if you have a ton of mana either bribe should get you a crisis.

v5.15.1: (12/12/18)
Fixed a couple issues with ascension II tower of grinding - you can't bank infinite entries now, using a banked entry shouldn't reset your timer, and cleaned up a bit of the code there. Also when grinding, enemy health should be properly multiplied. 

v5.15.0: (12/11/2018)
Added tower ascension II. Fixed an issue with a building showing up in the groupings list that shouldn't have. Buying a garden event closes if garden is successfully purchased. Fixed display of party stats in the tower. Turkeys no longer show up. Also, enter adventure mode to get your 2018 present!

v5.14.2: (11/28/18) Minor bugfixes + QOL + Balance
Added a new theme. If you have the essence compressor unlocked, it should stay unlocked through prestige. Balance: Reduced trade max value (caps at 10k free mana instead of 1m now). Reduced strength of some of the new drinks. Also, it tells you your party strength in the Tavern now.

v5.14.1: (11/27/18) Tower Ascension bugfix
You can now get mithril cloth even if you got the magic bag through tower. Also fix some minor typos in tower ascension.

v5.14.0: (11/27/18) Tower Ascension!
Added Tower ascension. When you get to the top of the tower (30 floors and a boss at the top), you can reset it to gain 4 new floors (and get a harder tower, after the first ascension). Get to the top of the tower for more information. Oh, also this adds the Essence Compressor to easily turn all your mana into essence, available at the top of the tower Ascension I. Also, bugfixes: when getting warned you can't refine that much mana at once, it now also caps how much you get. Probably also more that I'm not thinking of. 

v5.13.3: (11/21/18) Emergency bugfix
If you're at the top of the tower, entering tower of grinding should no longer let you get the final reward without resetting grinding entry time.

v5.13.2: (11/21/18) Bugfixes, start work on new tower stuff
Bag of folding fill all button now works. Poverty challenge doesn't give the placeholder 1 money/s. Tower of grinding now lets you actually get to the top. Start working on content for when you reach the top of the tower. 

v5.13.1: (11/15/18) Lots of small stuff
Added a button to put everything in your bag of folding. Added an option to turn off all confirmation boxes. No upgrade challenge mana requires you to start it with less than 500. Added a reward for the poverty challenge. Added a reward for getting to the top of the tower of grinding (also, if you get there wow).

v5.13.0: (11/13/18) IDK, some random stuff
Fixed the AI Growth Upgrade. Man, that was messed up. Also there's a couple new tower floors that help you get through crisises faster. And one for even more mana. Oh, also added some limits to mana refinery and trades that'll only appear if you're at ridiculous amounts of mana (10k and 1m).

v5.12.0: (11/6/18) Alchemy
Started some work on alchemist! There's now 2 ingredients to collect. When getting mana purifier, it says it lasts through prestige now. Also added 4 new tower floors, 3 of which improve autobuild (if you have it) and the last gives you more mana! Also an AI Unit upgrade that's probably broken!

v5.11.0: (11/3/18) Turkeys!
Halloween has ended. No more candy for you. Also, there's some wild turkeys to kill. Fixed a bug with getting negative fuel from the magic bag. 

v5.10.1: (10/18/18) Minor changes
Prestige and quickmana work a bit better now. Halloween candy now stacks properly when used. Perfect logikittens no longer give essence or magic bag. Spikey kneepads now do something.

v5.10.0: (10/12/18) Autobuild, balance changes, and bugfixes
Autobuild has been added! Get it from finishing the Cascade challenge!
When entering a challenge, mana you would get on prestige is added to the total you get when you finish (instead of it disappearing). Buying an upgrade to finish a crisis gives a hint about the wanderer. No upgrade challenge suggests you have the magic bag before starting it. You can now use halloween candy without already having a potion going. If you have enough mana, it now says that the risky regulation might be worth it. 

v5.9.1: (10/10/18) Minor bugfixes.
It is now actually possible to trick or treat. If there have been multiple updates since you last refreshed, it shows you all of them. When choosing events with purified mana, you can't choose an event you can't afford. Finishing the environmental crisis no longer gives a ~.5% boost to production (or whatever insignificantly small amount it was). Enchantments now scale by log base 2 instead of ~2.08.

v5.9.0: (10/7/18) Halloween
When adventuring, you'll now randomly encounter houses to trick or treat at. Don't ask why they're in space. The halloween theme now has fabulous music to go along with it. In the export save fallback, Ctrl+A and Ctrl+C should now work properly.

v5.8.3: Even more minor bugfix
Now both ways export can fail should properly fall back.

v5.8.2: (10/7/18) Minor bugfixes
Saving should theoretically now work for bluerobes. Tower floor 23 reward now works properly for money. Poverty challenge description fixed.

v5.8.1: (9/28/18) Bugfixes
Trying to make mithril cloth without enough resources gives the proper error message now. Any building built by the game should no longer say you don't have enough resources (mostly relevant for Cascade challenge). Changed current final tower floor a bit. It's super OP now (maybe). The automatic update checker now theoretically won't hang your game if you lose internet connection. No upgrade challenge also gives you 200 mana. 

v5.8.0: (9/23/18) Bugfixes and some more tower stuff
Fixed a display bug with cath notification settings. Meteors will no longer hit the last copy of a building. Workshop tooltip no longer shows up in resource tracking tooltips. When in No Upgrade Challenge, trades no longer flicker (and simply don't appear). Added a new tower floor, with rewards that may change (so you might want to hold off on killing it). Added some new combat messages in the tower. Added content to the tavern.

v5.7.1: (9/19/18) Minor Bugfixes and balance
Meteor challenge meteors fall at half the rate now, but speed time makes more fall (sorry, no more abusing offline progress to make it easier). You're no longer severly penalized for having a lot of money in your Magic Bag when doing a poverty challenge. You can no longer enter the main tower in a challenge. Unlocking tavern happens at the right boss now. 

v5.7.0: (9/18/18) 
Added a couple clues for the clouds of dust at Piscine. Fix a bug with the game not automatically checking for updates. Added a new tower boss and name/description for the previous two that didn't have one. Also, this adds the tavern which isn't fully implemented yet, but will allow you to upgrade your party. 

v5.6.0: (9/4/18) Not as terrible bugs
Fixed some stuff with how the bag of folding works with prestige resources. Also, sandcastles are now worth 1/2 as much (they were incorrectly being counted twice previously, and now it's fixed). Added a couple new tower floors, but they're not really finished yet. The rewards work, but no boss names/descriptions. Added more links in the tower to help you get back to the base. Oh, and the tower warrior should now work properly, at least once you've killed the boss on floor 20.

v5.5.0: (9/2/18) BUGS!
Absolutely no testing in this version! It'll hopefully not break stuff too bad. Anyways, there's a few more hints for what to do in adventure (one at Piscine, one at Abandoned World, one at Cath when getting starchart). The settings menu is now not in the exact same place adventuring is because that annoyed me. Hopefully the game should now alert you when there's an update and you're still playing, but it might not. Workshop and enchanting table now tell you how they work (hopefully well enough) and enchanting table has some things changed to be more mechanically different than workshop. Workshop tells you to check your ship stock instead of warehouse. The warrior in the tower now (theoretically) can help fight for you. Don't let them die! Also, added 4 more floors to the tower. You can now beat up some random British dude and his brother!

v5.4.1: (8/30/18) Settings
When fueling your ship, it should show higher precision numbers for how much fuel you have. There's also now a settings menu for a bunch of stuff at top that was getting crowded. And a couple new things in there: You can (maybe) get notified when Cath resources are off cooldown, and you can use scientific notation instead of normal suffixes. Also there's a donate link that hopefully works.

v5.4.0: (8/22/18) Even more tower
Cath purchase timer should now reset on prestige. Also 5 new tower floors (and 4 new functional tower rewards. Next one coming soon!)

v5.3.0: (8/19/18) More tower floors
I actually tested stuff this time! Added a couple new tower floors and added a new spell: AI. It gives managers (currently at a terrible rate, but it should get upgrades to improve it later). Bag of folding is slightly better if you've finished meteor challenge and don't have a lot of resources in it. When grinding the tower, you now don't need to do it alone! Bring along a buddy to heal you... if you've gotten high enough. 

v5.2.1: (8/17/18) Tower bugfixes
I guess I should really test stuff first. Anyways, tower should be functional again. And if you play NGU, have you taken your drink?

v5.2.0: (8/17/18) More tower stuff
Meteors challenge should no longer hit unbuyable buildings. Expect a nerf to speed time on it soon (meteors will hit faster if time is sped). Added floor 8 to the tower, which unlocks a smaller tower to grind some Essence. Oh, also that tower to grind essence might have horribly broken stuff with the regular tower and/or is horribly broken itself. Added some messages for tower buttons so they feel less meaningless.

v5.1.1: (8/16/18) Balance stuff and bugfixes
If you've finished the environmental crisis you can now buy books at Cath. Also a few unbuyable buildings after it are now buyable, but at high costs. Getting a ton of time should no longer count against you. You can no longer destroy unbuyable buildings. Bags of holding say they disappear on prestige. Refined mana can no longer warp in resources you have a negative amount of. And that's pretty much it.

v5.1.0: (8/13/18) Bugfixes and more tower
Changed the no encounter text as it's now a known bug. I'll get around to fixing it eventually. 3 new upgrades added! Get them from beating tower boss 7. Also fixed a few bugs with the essence and mana not displaying properly until refresh. 

v5.0.3: (8/13/18) More bugfixes
Fixed a typo when getting cheese. Mage skills should no longer lock you out of the warpgate. Increased solar panel glass cost and generation post-environmental disaster.

v5.0.2: (8/12/18) The Tower
Fixed a bug where using some potions in quick succession could give you negative resources per second. If this continues to appear, tell me what potions you used and I'll fix it on those. Meteor and loan challenges now have rewards. Removed the option to delete some buildings (hydrogen mine, basic challenge rewards, and mana purifier)

v5.0.1: (8/8/18) The Tower
Small bugfixes: Fixed omnivision (second one) to properly show values, not hoe much you have. It should no longer push some buttons down in the resource pane. Also, convolution cube no longer requires "antibag". 

v5.0.0: (8/7/18) The Tower
You can now actually do stuff at the tower. Climb up the tower, killing various bosses in a horrible game of rock paper scissors and gain great rewards along the way! But it'll really tax your mana - I hope you have a lot stored up.

v4.6.0: (8/7/18) The Tower
Finished another couple mage skills. Omnivision and distributed mana are done. One gives you a boost to mana gained depending on your resource values. One lets you see some more stats (and I can add more in the future if I remember). Also probably another 3 gamebreaking bugs added.

v4.5.0: (8/7/18) The Tower
Fixed a bug that made prestiging just not work at all. Magic bag now has hotkey "B". No upgrade challenge has a reward: you get 1 essence! Essence unlocks the tower, which lets you get even more essence. It also gives a 10% (additive) production bonus to most resources for each essence you have. (Tower hotkey is "T")

v4.4.1: (8/6/18) Start challenge rewards
Basic challenge now actually has a reward, but it'll take a lot of mana to get full use from it! Fixed a bug with getting quick mana from the mage skill. The game should actually load now. 

v4.4.0: (8/5/18) Version 4.4.0: (8/5/18): Version Okay, that's enough.
Added a new challenge: No upgrade challenge! You just don't get upgrades. Sounds fun. Mithril cloth mithril cost 1000 -> 150 (5 bags of holding). Enchanting table should now actually work with casino tokens.

v4.3.0: (7/30/18) Bag of Folding
You're slightly likeier to get void, but it reduces the fullness of the black hole. Changed challenge rewards to describe what they likely will be. Check it out and if you have a good reward idea, please tell me! Also, added the bag of folding. It lets you throw resources in it, and then get some free resources at the start of each prestige!

v4.2.0: (7/20/18) Even More Challenge
Two new challenges: cascade and disco. Cascade will take some planning!

v4.1.3: (7/19/18) More Challenge
You should now actually get a logicat when adventuring where logicats appear.

v4.1.2: (7/18/18) More challenge
Meteors no longer hit mana stones and spell buildings. They also should update the amount it displays you have. Also, the meteor event is now no longer a good thing when in the challenge. It's very painful actually.

v4.1.2: (7/17/18) More challenge
When in a challenge you can now only have 5 hydrogen mines. This should make them harder. Hydrogen mines also generate less hydrogen, but since they're still uncapped, eh.

v4.1.1: (7/16/18) More challenge
Oops, it now shouldn't force you into meteor challenge.

v4.1.0: (7/16/18) More challenge
The challenge gate is now a warp gate location. Meteor challenge should actually be a thing now. Poverty challenge max money reduced (40s of production -> 20s, because I remembered money printers exist). Manufacturing tooltips are correct if you're an inventor now. Halloween theme is once again available, because why not.

v4.0.2: (7/1/18) 
Fixed some stuff with the casino rewards. They should now actually purchase correctly.

v4.0.1: (6/15/18) Challenges!
Minor balance: reduced the costs of some stuff, mostly iron costs.

v4.0.0: (6/15/18) Challenges!
There's now a few challenges you can do! Theoretically all but meteor challenge should be working, but there's probably bugs. Oh, also you can go to adventure mode as soon as you have any fuel. 

v3.23.0: (6/13/18) Challenge stuff
Added a new "planet", right off of Marine World (the casino). You can see the current planned challenges there, and it'll be where you start them! Oh, also I changed some CSS stuff with tables, so if you notice a place where they look terrible tell me. And challenges should be coming soon! More hype!

v3.22.4: (6/13/18) Bugfixes.
Fixed a bug where (theoretically) you could get NaN mana on prestige. Getting mana before prestige from the mage skill should now correctly unlock new spells without needing to refresh. Moved some code around to hopefully make it more performant. Also, started some stuff for the implementation of challenges! Get hyped! Oh, and I'm putting dates in the changelog now.

v3.22.3: I need to add a settings menu sometime
Sandcastles give 10m prestige value again (instead of their previous weird formula). You can now set the update rate - it switches between 100ms (fast) and 1000ms (slow). Mithril plating now gives more shields. It's also called mithril plating when you craft it (not adamantium). 

v3.22.2: 
Your logicat level and stealth level are now shown at the place where you first find them. You can now buy some prizes at the casino. How useful are they? Find out!

v3.22.1: Small changes you don't care about
Added a tooltip for another mage skill, fixed being able to prestige for negative mana. Also, there's a new enchantment. You can get casino tokens easier now! And there's an interface to spend them on prizes, but it doesn't let you do that yet. Feel free to give me suggestions for specific prizes!

v3.22.0: Enchantments!
There's now some enchantments you can make. Effectively, you start it, wait a while (1-24hrs, affected by time speed), and can then claim it for a reward! (Click the GREEN button on the dropdown to get your reward). Note that you'll need to prestige to be able to do this.

v3.21.0: I guess this is a version
How do you like unfinished content? I love it! Anyways, there's a new spell building available. It's kind of like the workshop, but more useless, mostly because you can't do anything with it. Oh, also ninja stealth is now stealthily more powerful. 

v3.20.1: Oops
Hotfix for a bug with strong encounter selection skills. You could previously have Temporal Slow, Temporal Anger, and Temporal Rage and get the effects of Temporal Absence. Now you can't (probably). Also, they have tooltips!

v3.20.0: Mage stuff
Finished more mage skills: COMBAT II, NONCOMBAT II (they still need names) and Foresight are now implemented. They may have bugs. 

v3.19.0: Surprise!
Inventors can now Fortify some buildings, doubling ALL production rates (including negative ones). One more mage skill (Mana Frontloading) has been implemented. It's probably pretty buggy. 

v3.18.1:
Fixed a bug where sometimes the logikitten perfect bonus was still in the resource/second change list but not accounted for. You can now get more than 1 carrot seed per prestige. 

v3.18.0: Gardening
Added a new encounter and resource/use for fuel: void. What will it do? Another nerf to CSOP: you need to have a nonzero resources/s for it to give you stuff of each resource. Added some basic gardening. Currently you can grow... 1 carrot per prestige. More seeds will probably be added later. 

v3.17.2:
More slot machine improvements. There's now many more upgrades you can get for it. Still probably not worth playing.

v3.17.1:
Improved the slot machine at the casino. It still probably isn't worth it, but why not try it out and upgrade it a bit? Also decreased the update rate to improve performance.

v3.17.0:
Added a casino you can lose money at. Seriously, the slots have a 2.7% return. Don't play them.

v3.16.2:
Fix CSOP and mana purifier cost (should be 10x what it was). Broken chair can be bought more than once. Reduced free fuel per prestige and fuel required to adventure.

v3.16.1: Purified Mana and More
Unlocking AutoEvents now will actually destroy your shields. You can now construct a mana purifier (if you have a lot of KP). Fixed a bug with AutoEvents always triggering because of blank fields. Fixed a bug with high-level logicat rewards being impossible to get. Oh, and once you get purified mana the hotkey to use it is C.

v3.16.0: Purified Mana and More
There's now some machines that self-replicate on the Abandoned World (not colony). They can give you some good loot. Added purified mana and a building to make it. There's no way to get that building yet though. Added another small starting bonus - if you have 400 or more mana, you start with 1 free fuel. There's some new logikitten rewards too. The perfect cat bonus should now theoretically show up in the tracking tooltips for resources. 

v3.15.3:
Choosing alchemy from the wanderer sucks less (this change will be removed when Alchemist actually gets stuff). Slightly nerfed Chairs Sit on People (you now need some of a resource for it to be set to 1/s). Further nerfed sandcastle prestige value. When bribing, if you have enough mana for a disaster to happen there's an extra message telling you which to bribe (or not bribe). Fixed a weird internal bug that had no effect on gameplay.

v3.15.2:
Nerfed sandcastles a bit because with Chairs Sit on People they're super powerful. Also added code to start getting some data on one of the mage upgrades.

v3.15.1: π breaks stuff.
Having some characters like π in the changelog should no longer break exporting.

v3.15.0: No more π.
Implemented 3 more mage skills: Adventure encounter selectors and a skill to get more stuff from enemies.

v3.14.1(59): Pi
Fixed a bug where perfect logikittens could infinitely stack (due to the wearing off message happening too quickly.) 

v3.14.0: Actual Skill Tree
It's clearer that you'll lose ship parts when you get PC/AutoEvents. The skill tree for Magic option from wanderer is now interactive and skills are buyable. Only some of them work (anything with a non-TODO tooltip).

v3.13.1: Skill Tree
Added a skill tree for the mage. There aren't skills yet, but the tree looks nice. Changed Chronomancy description. Changed how Chairs Sit On People works slightly. Now it's probably even more broken. 

v3.13.0: QoL Update
Fixed small issue with last resource having a border when it wasn't needed. Resources now have a tooltip showing what's modifying them. Note that some sources won't be tracked (and there might be some bugs with it), so please report those as bugs if you find any. Water collector tooltip says exactly how much mana you need. You can bribe politicians without having coal mining (but you should get coal mining first anyways). Added a weird new upgrade and a way to undo it. Wanderer can show up without you doing any adventure mode stuff. Wanderer can be male or female.

v3.12.0:
Made the increased scaling cost of libraries lower. Added a book recycler. Fixed a bug with Mithril Forges not updating KP left. It is past Christmas so you can't get a gift anymore. Steel and Mithril machines now take managers to run (starting from your next prestige). However, there's an upgrade to make Skyscrapers cheaper. Fixed a bug with Panther Rush. 

v3.11.0: Merry Christmas!
Added a giant drill. You can now open your present. Demons now come for you slightly earlier and it shows how much in debt you are there. The logikitten boost for more points now unlocks correctly. Changed a small interaction involving perfect logikittens. Merry Christmas!

v3.10.0: Event Automation
Added event automation. There's an upgrade that lets you get free points from logic puzzles. Your affililiation with demons is shown. Logikittens are logged. 

v3.9.1: The Wanderer
All clouds of dust now lead to the Small Cloud. Added a suggested prestige amount. Getting sludge should work better if you refresh. 

v3.9.0: The Wanderer
Minor CSS fix: You should now be able to easily highlight your purchased upgrades to easily share them. Fixed a bug with bags of holding not opening. New shield available for crafting: mithril plating (requires being an Inventor). Convolution cube now shouldn't do weird things with requiring sludge. 

v3.8.0: The Wanderer
You can forge Mithril now! Well, if you're an inventor. Also fixed a small tooltip bug. 

v3.7.0: The Wanderer
Cath trading has been nerfed. You can now only take each deal once every 10 minutes, so make them count. Choosing Magic or Technology now does stuff! Specifically, a bag of holding (yay, starting bonuses) and two new buildings. You're now more likely to invest in uranium. Your first artifact should actually give the full 1000 refined mana. Fixed a bug in a easter egg "bug" (yes, our bugs even have bugs!) Chronomancy requires more mana. Solar panels generate less fuel after you finish the environmental crisis. Fixed a bug where you could accidentally prestige for infinite mana. Added a new title. NOTE: Bags of holding will be harder to get in the future, however I they're necessary for something I want to implement soon, so they're easy to get now.

v3.6.1: The Wanderer.
Fixed a bug where adventuring in Piscine would sometimes simply not work. Prestige shows % to next mana (kind of, it's an approximation and each subsequent % is harder). Choosing a class with the wanderer gives minor bonuses: Magic makes refined mana twice as effective (before being capped for resources that cap), Alchemy makes potions slightly stronger, and Inventor makes Manufacturing better.

v3.6.0: Environmental Disaster!
When adding fuel, it shows how much you have to add. You can now use libraries to gain knowledge points and use those to reset the cost of libraries. More uses will come soon (TM). New upgrade to make libraries even cheaper (it'll be needed). Convolution cubes now have a different starting state depending on how many you've solved. The wanderer only shows you 2 options out of the 3 possible ones. Environmental and financial crises now happen at alternating amounts of mana. Fixed a bug with getting more sludge after you solved the environmental disaster. Coming soon (maybe): Tracking of what's all increasing/decreasing your resource gains.

v3.5.1: Environmental Disaster!
Fixed a bug where buying some buildings would turn them off, even if you had the production to back them up.

v3.5.0: Environmental Disaster!
Changed Piscine fuel costs to not be more expensive to adventure there than to enter. Also edited cloud maze exit cost and Haven links there instead of directly to Piscine. Fixed a bug with financial collapse fixing where you could get double money from banks for a bit. Added an Environmental Disaster and a way to solve it. Resources you have none of are hidden again. Unbuyable buildings are actually unbuyable. When setting up a rule, you can only have it use resources you have. Some buildings now cost less, some buildings can now give a percent gain to resources (only applied to net /s if it's positive). Fixed a couple bugs with the Convolution Cube (and some balance changes.) The Wanderer can now teach you. There isn't anything really once you've learned a subject, but that will be added later. Added some hotkeys: ESC or X to close events and adventure mode, 0-9 to choose event (and I guess adventure) options, F to force event, T to speed/slow time, R to refine mana, +/- to change Thaumaturgic converter level, and A to adventure. Added a Christmas present. Added a new title. Oh, also you'll probably need to prestige. I'm sorry.

v3.4.1+:
Please make sure you prestige within the next week! New stuff is coming out that will make it impossible to progress in your current prestige if you don't!

v3.4.1:
Upgrading carrots is now more expensive. You now need to know some alchemy before you can unlock Production Control (mostly for checking later on stuff easier). Potions of Space Sight now don't let you get ridiculous amounts of fuel when combined with speed time. Carrots are harder to find. Having Chronomancy can sometimes make events more common.

v3.4.0:
Oh yeah, also forgot to add resource multipliers. That will also be used later, so make sure you prestige sometime within the next month or so. And now I can't actually forget to update the version number as it's automatic. Also fixed a bug where speed time + energy buildings would turn off the energy buildings. There's also a new event. It doesn't do anything yet, but it's planned.

v3.3.0:
A bit more flavor text for machines, some backend stuff that will be used later (just want it so people will have prestiged by the time it's used). Added a new boost to use time quicker (and if you have it time will also speed up the early stages of financial collapse). Oh, also added some code to check if you're on a new version!

v3.2.1:
Okay, you can actually get to the abandoned planet. Yay!

v3.2.0:
There's a new world with not much. You can get rules unlocked there, but that unlock will probably be pushed back a bit in the future. Fixed strobe mode a bit. Also added a new style - Christmas Lights!

v3.1.2+:
Potions of Burninating now will not melt you far into the negatives. As fun as it may have been, it can't last. Mountains and Forests aren't so powerful. Also, fixed a bunch of capitalization issues with upgrade names. Also, added production control (in testing, not available from normal play yet. Put $("#pc_box").parent().removeClass("hidden"); into the console to unlock it temporarily, tell me what you think!)

v3.1.1:
Slight prestige formula changes. Also added 6 more mana start buildings and moved one to be earlier. 

v3.1.0:
Hydrogen engines generate more energy and can be upgraded to be net neutral. Mines and logging camps cost less, and there's an upgrade to further reduce the price. It's slightly easier to get mana. Buildings now produce resource /s instead of resource per second. 3 new titles. Having mana gives you some buildings on prestige. Also fixed some bugs with the trading portal and fixed the tooltip.

v3.0.1:
The long-awaited upgrade fix! Should fix the strange issue where clicking an upgrade wouldn't buy it sometimes. Also, costs you can't pay are colored red now.

v3.0.0:
Turkeys have disappeared. You ate them all. The buff helps you in combat now too! Oh, you can also brew potions.

v2.17.0:
You can fight wild turkeys! Get some turkey legs! Bugfixes and improvements: Hydrogen mines should show the correct amount after prestige. When logikitten perfect buff runs out it says so in the log. Fixed an issue where you never got the option to end the financial crisis. 

v2.16.2:
Clouds of dust now tell you their own state if they're on and didn't change. Bottles are harder to get but worth more. Fixed a bug with demon trading. 

v2.16.1:
Favicon now changes when there's an event.

v2.16.0:
You can now visit the homeworld of the sharks, Haven. What do they have to teach you? Will you become a master alchemist? Well, at least you can manage your buildings better now. Quite useful, actually. Also fixed a bug with Magic Orb (energy) not giving energy but taking it. Made a blatantly overpowered potion that you won't get, but is a useful test for alchemy potions doing things.

v2.15.4:
Groupings now kind of work, they just need to be saved. Demons no longer trade a negative amount of diamonds. 

v2.15.3:
Hydrogen mines should carry over between prestiges. This is untested, but hopefully it works. The gray button on the convolution cube should actually work properly now. Financial crisis has had the balance changed. 

v2.15.2:
Prestige no longer breaks in middle of button if your window is too small. Same for all off/all on buttons. Setting to strobe now gives a warning. The "saved" notification was moved a bit. Started work on better building management. Fixed a couple issues with the convolution cube.

v2.15.1:
Fixed bug where ghostly lever would add half your points instead of subtract it.

v2.15.0:
What you've all been waiting for - strobe theme!

v2.14.4:
Small bugfix with convolution cube.

v2.14.3:
Added image for Sandpaper. Demons taking resources should have the amount formatted now. You can now only get 1 production boost from logikittens. Special resources have the line under them colored. 

v2.14.2:
Really small update here. Finished the cube, changed a few things that could let you get stuck, and made the event window scroll better.

v2.14.1:
Resources now have a line under them. It should help with seeing your /s better. The convolution cube is almost fully implemented. (If solving it turns out to be impossible, tell me because that's important)

v2.14.0:
Logikittens now no longer have statements in the form of Exactly one of Statement A and Statement A is true/false. They also tell you what level you are. And there's a new reward from them, which isn't fully implemented yet.

v2.13.1:
Flux Capacitor generates slightly less time. Fixing a financial crisis now sets your money/s back to what it should be. Special resources are once again properly colored. 

v2.13.0:
Added a financial crisis that happens. If you can survive it, you'll come out stronger than before. Good luck.

v2.12.3:
Maybe fix logicats perfect stuff? Hopefully it doesn't break everything. Resources don't have extra decimals (oops).

v2.12.2:
Bugfixes: you can turn on buildings that get you money even if you have negative money. You can also see negative money. You can no longer go into debt to bribe. You can adventure if you have no fuel, but your ship does.

v2.12.1:
Changed PRNG function, so logicat reward order changed again. 

v2.12.0:
Gas cloud puzzle has messages better randomized. There's a new weapon you can make. Boom!

v2.11.1:
The prestige button should now show mana gained on prestige.

v2.11.0:
Added a Flux Capacitor. Fixed a typo with the logging upgrade. Spooky lights are now gone (until next year, if I remember to turn them on).

v2.10.1:
All NaN amounts of resources should automatically be set back to 0. Unless you have NaN generators, in which case you need help.

v2.10.0:
Piscine encounter says there's nothing else when there's nothing else (more may be added later!), but it now connects to a puzzle/maze area. See if you can get to the end. Added something to have some encounters able to appear anywhere, but nothing uses it yet. Some items can be used for various benefits. There's new titles that can appear. 

v2.9.2:
Added spooky lights.

v2.9.1:
Unlocking science at Piscine now works slightly better. You should no longer be able to build sandcastles and then buy upgrades again. 

v2.9.0:
Added Piscine encounter that lets you learn Science! Added new engine which isn't super useful yet, but will be with some weapons (not yet added). 

v2.8.0:
Umbra now has a reward for throwing stuff away. Added glass bottles (which you can't get yet). Spoopy link to something added. You can go to Piscine, but you can't do stuff there. Loading with a workshop that's on under some conditions no longer breaks your game. Logicats now give most boosts through levels (this DOES mess up the ordering, so find the new order of what each level gives.)

v2.7.1:
Small bugfixes: you now actually need 50 mana to get steel beams and can't cheat by spamming to keep buildings on. Refined mana now can warp fractions of any resource in. So you won't get 1 castle per warp.

v2.7.0:
Smurf encounter isn't missing a newline. You can get sandcastles. Glass value increased, but it takes more sand to smelt glass. You can use sand to buy sandcastles. Meteors give more stone and gold. Logicat levels do things. Each level gives a reward. The reward progression is deterministic, but the pattern may change if I add more rewards.

v2.6.0:
When adventuring, you have less of a chance of finding a logikitten now. In terminus, the freezing noncombat is less likely. Fixed a bug with upgrades that give buildings potentially giving none. Logikittens now say what rewards you got. 

v2.5.1:
Logikittens don't give energy/mana/similar. 

v2.5.0:
Added new adventure mode location. Umbra has a new adventure that expands ship storage. Your first event after reload appears sooner if you have the upgrade that does it. You can find cute kittens while you're there and they give rewards for solving puzzles.

v2.4.1:
Umbra encounter now doesn't let you get NaN fuel, re-adventuring in a place should turn red if you don't have enough fuel. 

v2.4.0:
New umbra encounter (throw some stuff away), oil well upgrades no longer check production of oil wells, mana gain power reduced (but not as much as raised, so still a bit higher), embezzling gives more stuff (may still not be enough, but yay uranium!), eregs boosts oil wells. Also started work on new event, use force_event(10) in the console to try it out (not interactive yet, but it's coming soon, unlocked by adventure mode!)

v2.3.2:
Mana is slightly easier to get. Time now is used up faster. You can see a few mana buildings ahead maybe. Factory is once again at 50 mana.

v2.3.1:
Investments should have proper sigfigs, bribing a politician shows up earlier and tells you that you need banks. Trade portal tells you that unused mana helps it, time rewind no longer has an inaccurate tooltip.

v2.3.0:
New location: Umbra. Also there's a mysterious warpgate. Also adventuring should be less laggy. 

v2.2.3:
Tooltips now have the proper background color, positive resources will now not be red. 

v2.2.2:
Shield images now have transparent background. Light theme secondary color is lighter. Workshop menu changes with theme.

v2.2.1:
Ice giant should be more common. Hydrogen mines should build one, not 2 and give proper /s generation. You can now switch from the dark theme to an even worse light theme.

v2.2.0:
Changelog renamed (Technomancy instead of Crappy Incremental). Add new hopefully not broken ice giant encounter. Unbuyable buildings now say so.

v2.1.1:
You can now actually get hydrogen from the moon encounter (bug fixed), gold sifters use less stone, printing press upgrade text is fixed, resources with negative values use the positive version in prestige.

v2.1.0:
You can now buy iron ore at Cath. Add two library upgrades. Destroying buildings refunds 30% of the build cost. Setting to buy multiple actually updates tooltops properly. Removing fuel says "Remove" instead of "Add". You can make machine parts and build mines on the moon. Making more small lasers is now harder and equally useless.

v2.0.1:
Space squid rewards you on killing it. It has a slightly different AI now too. Also winning/losing fights is better. 

v2.0.0:
Adventure mode! A total of 4 locations available to explore! A dazzling space squid to fight! Also a boring bugfix with fuel generation. 

v1.18.2:
Nothing shows in the /s area if you're getting 0/s, if it's negative it shows up red. 

v1.18.1:
Add upgrade for more common events. Investments now gain much more money. Artifacts give more refined mana but it decreases over time. Demons give you more stuff. Workshop bar now changes color depending on if it is working or not.

v1.18.0:
Time rewind costs more mana. Added upgrade to make time rewind cheaper. Reduced bribing mana cost back to what it was. Uranium upgrades now take having 200 mana to show up.

v1.17.2:
Coal mines now no longe take more coal than you can initially see them with.

v1.17.1:
Fuel making now takes even more research.

v1.17.0:
Politician bribing is harder. Lots of balance changes: factory takes 75 mana, mines and logging camps are slightly more expensive, furnaces cost more money, gold sifters cost more, oil wells cost more stone and produce less oil, book printers cost more, most end-game buildings have cost increases along with virtually every upgrade. Added oil well upgrades. Mana division rate is harsher.

v1.16.1:
Added notification to export.

v1.16.0:
New wiki link added, solar panel added.

v1.15.9:
You can now invest in antique items, you can't invest in rugs, meteors give more energy and potentially uranium.

v1.15.8:
Doubled mana value, titles change 10x less often.

v1.15.7:
Removed link to the wiki. It was horribly out of date.

v1.15.6:
Bugfixes: Time speed turns off visibly when you run out of time. You can't spam click mana buildings to use them. You can't force an event when you have one. Energy converter is clearer about costs.

v1.15.5:
Slight fix for rapidly changing values. Now resource values are better shown.

v1.15.4:
Slight endgame change. Framework set up for me to actually maybe make adventuring a thing soon.

v1.15.3:
Small numbers should show properly. Building costs are now formatted.

v1.15.2:
Start transition to new number formatter, fix bug where building tooltips weren't colored correctly.

v1.15.1:
Event window is now smaller. Not as small as some people would like though. Building tooltips show what resource you need.

v1.15.0:
Workshop is no longer default on. Glass furnace is easier to get. Title changed. New event added for those with < 50 mana. Rickrolling no longer autoplays. Hopefully fixed a strange bug with workshop menu always showing.

v1.14.0:
Added workshop. This one you actually have to craft things manually. 

v1.13.1:
Fuel maker now uses refined mana as it should.

v1.13.0:
You can now use uranium to make fuel! Mana refinery moved to above greed as it can cost less. Workshop renamed to Manufacturing. Mana now caps trades much quicker. With both upgrades, you can still get steel beams. You need a ton of mana to bribe politicians.

v1.12.0:
Event box is now more annoying (it scrolls with you). Nuclear reactor added. Steel is worth more. Added uranium for your reactors. Trading portal upgrades are more expensive. Total upgrades no longer show. Slight prestige formula fix.

v1.11.0:
Go bribe some politicians now. It can do things.

v1.10.2:
Energy boost starts at a default of 1 instead of 2. Logging camp upgrade takes >= 5 mana instead of > 5. Bank upgrade takes >= 20 instead of > 20. You can actually gain more than 6 mana (reduction of >50 gains were mistakenly applied too early.) Rickrolling autoplays once per prestige now.

v1.10.1:
Gaining > 50 mana at once is now a bit harder. Slight visual improvement to upgrade list (tooltip doesn't go away on hover and you can highlight upgrades).

v1.10.0:
Added an option to force events. Demons now punish being greedy. Trading upgrades nerfed.

v1.9.0:
Added new events: trading with demons. But please be careful! Also fixed a bug with being able to go at fast speed infinitely with enough refined mana. Good catch!

v1.8.2:
Better trades no longer buff jewelry stores.

v1.8.1:
You can once again prestige for 0 mana.

v1.8.0:
Slight nerf to boost. Mines and logging scale better. Various buildings have costs changed. Strip mines slightly nerfed. Two upgrades that improve trading portal. Mana refinery works as it should now (if it broke, please prestige to fix it). Speed time works with mana buildings. Meteors have another resource they can make. New event added.

v1.7.2:
Warping items in now shows their names properly.

v1.7.1:
You now don't get bothered if refined mana makes nothing. Fixed prestige to say mana stone.

v1.7.0:
Added mana refinery. Changed value of time and removed it from trading.

v1.6.2:
Jewelry stores should NOT give managers. They should use them.

v1.6.1:
Investment banks and strip mines should now no longer show up early.

v1.6.0:
Added glass jeweler, investment bank, strip mine. Changed how offline generation works. Slightly reduced value of gold, diamond, jewelry, and books and reduced money gain from jewelry stores. Added a few new jewelry-related upgrades.

v1.5.0:
Changed prestige formula to make long runs much more rewarding.

v1.4.0:
Added skyscrapers and managers (currently they do nothing :( ). Sand, glass, hydrogen values increased. Steel beams added. Logging camp upgrade. Events no longer disappear. Workshop options slightly renamed. Workshop productions changed slightly.

v1.3.0:
Add new building: workshop! Meteors should now say what you get in the log. Reorganized spell buildings. You need to prestige to have some function again.

v1.2.4:
Gold magnets no longer secretly take coal. Trading no longer messes up the upgrade tooltip. Events are logged. Meteors now no longer slowly deplete your energy until you refresh. Greed spell renamed to Greed.

v1.2.3:
Add log so you can see past events. Hotter furnaces don't use quite as much wood. Oh, and a new event! Make sure to play with volume on!

v1.2.2:
Greed now doesn't double negative net production and has a better tooltip. Water purifier moved to correct position. Ink refinery has the proper tooltip. Prestige has a tooltip giving some explanation.

v1.2.1:
Reordered buildings to hopefully make a bit more sense.

v1.2.0:
Add time warping spell. Increase mana cost of energy converter. Add finding oil reserves to make oil wells cost less iron.

v1.1.0:
New event: meteor! A meteor can fall in your backyard! Events slightly less common. Removed arbitrary cap on investment gains. Events timeout after a minute.

v1.0.2:
Water purifier hints that prestige is required. Total upgrades now shows the actual number, not one higher.

v1.0.1:
Coal mining tooltip now properly reflects not needing research. Energy/research generation no longer says per second. Events now happen much less often (as they should have, I missed a 0) and investing gives a slight range.

v1.0.0:
Randomly generated events! You can now hit it rich on the stock market! Also added tooltip for purchased upgrades.

v0.6.3:
Tooltip bugfix with upgrades.

v0.6.2:
Banks can now be destroyed again. You can't destroy your last building of a type. Coal mines don't take research to buy. Some changes to hopefully make tooltips better.

v0.6.1:
Greed is now clearer in what it does. Fixed bug with trading not giving actual offers.

v0.6.0:
Add research, libraries, 3 new resources, 4 new buildings. There's now hydrogen engines: save up hydrogen and burn it for a short burst of energy! Trading is now slightly better if Greed is active. A few new upgrades.

v0.5.4:
Resource gain now displayed inline with the resource instead of in a tooltip.

v0.5.3:
Energy converter -/+ buttons now add or remove based on build amount setting. Upgrades turn red when you can't buy them.

Greed doesn't give extra gold even when it shouldn't.

v0.5.1:
You can no longer destroy banks. Greed now properly updates tooltips.

v0.5.0:
Added Gold sifter upgrade, upgrade count so you know how many you're missing, hides spells you can't pay for yet. Added building destruction.

v0.4.3:
All on/off buttons now ignore spells.

v0.4.2:
Can't set multibuy to less than 0. Added all on/ all off buttons.

v0.4.1:
Added more random titles. Added external save/load. Added buy multiple.

v0.4.0:
Should stop selection on more browsers. Add new expensive spell (more for getting started).

v0.3.3:
Trading portal tuning (now realizes that some resources are more valuable than others), slightly easier to get mana (every resource counts towards mana!), fix bug with trading portal hanging game if only limited resources and money are owned.

v0.3.2:
Slight portal tuning: sets max based on mana left instead of total mana. Fix bugs with potentially getting negative resources, add offline gen.

v0.3.1:
